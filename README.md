## Overview

[Discors](https://discors.herokuapp.com/#/) is a clone of the popular chat app [Discord](https://discordapp.com/). Users are able to create and join servers, send and accept/reject friend requests, upload custom avatars and server icons, create text channels and voice channels within servers, and message each other through text channels or through direct messaging.

The majority of [Discors](https://discors.herokuapp.com/#/) was designed and built within a span of 10 days.

## Technologies

Discors was built using React/Redux for the frontend and Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL for the backend. ActionCables were used to implement the live chat features and notifications. WebRTC was used in conjunction with ActionCables to create voice channels. User avatars and server icons are uploaded to [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) through Active Storage.
